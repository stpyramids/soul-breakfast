# SOUL ðŸ‘» BREAK ðŸ’€ FAST

_Revenge, like cereal, is best served cold_

My submission to the [2022 Seven Day Roguelike game jam](https://itch.io/jam/7drl-challenge-2022). The version submitted is the `7drl-2022` tag; this version is under continuing development.

I publish the latest dev release [here](https://mboeh.github.io/7drl-2022/).

## How to play:

The game includes tutorial messages, but the overall structure is:

- Find weak "vermin" enemies; devour their souls for essence (press 'd' while occupying their square).
- Use the essence to shoot auto-targeting bolts (with Space) at stronger enemies.
- Claim the souls of (non-vermin) enemies to increase your max essence and possibly additional powers.
- Spend essence to go through passages (>) to more dangerous areas with harder enemies.
- Try not to hit 0 essence: this can cause you to lose souls or even get kicked back into an earlier level.
- Release weaker souls (with 'r') and claim stronger ones.
- Achieve a max essence of 50 or higher and enter a passage to a danger level of 50 or higher. And win!

## Controls

Some of these are documented in game. Online

- h/j/k/l: Move in the cardinal directions. Hold Shift to move in a direction until you see an enemy or hit a wall.
- . (period): Wait a turn.
- Space: Fire a spell at the targeted (blue background) enemy. Costs 2 essence.
- d: Devour the soul of the creature you are currently standing on, gaining essence.
- c: Claim the soul of the creature you are currently standing on. You cannot claim a soul you are already holding. You need an empty slot.
- r: Release one of your claimed souls (press 1, 2, or 3 to pick a slot).
- \>: Enter a passage. You need (and will spend) as much essence as the danger level of the new level.

## Tips

- Conserve your essence.
- Not all enemies are worth fighting.
- Some souls are a double-edged sword.
- Positioning is key.
- Not all effects stack.
